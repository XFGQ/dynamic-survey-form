## Features

* **Dynamic Question Flow**: The next question is determined based on the answer given to the previous question.
* **Easy Management and Updates**: Using Python or C#, survey questions can be easily managed and edited with simple code structures.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a straightforward, terminal-based survey experience that’s easy to use.

---------------------------------------------

## Technologies Used

* **C#**: Presents the survey as a terminal application in C#.
* **Python**: Presents the survey as a terminal application in Python.

---------------------------------------------

## Project Structure

* **Python**: In Python, each question is asked in sequence based on the user's answer, and responses are collected. At the end, a result is displayed based on all the answers.
* **C#**: In C#, each question is asked in sequence based on the user’s answer, and responses are collected. At the end, a result is displayed based on all the answers.
